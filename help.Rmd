This application displays call/put option prices and greeks (delta, gamma, vega and theta) using the Black-Scholes method. 
The input parameters are:
- K is the strike price
- &sigma; is the standard diviation (or volatility)
- &tau; is the time from now until expiration, expressed in days
- r is the risk-free interest rate

"The Greeks" measure the sensitivity of the value of a derivative to changes in parameter value(s) while holding the other parameters fixed. They are partial derivatives of the price with respect to the parameter values. 

The application displays call/put option prices and greeks as a function of S, the current stock price using the Black-Scholes method. By changing the various input parameters, one can see how the option value and greeks change. 

More information about the Black-Scholes pricing model and its assumptions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackâ€“Scholes_model.
